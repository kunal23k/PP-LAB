Title: Math Functions and GUI Graph Plotter in Python

1. Objective:
This project implements arithmetic, quadratic, and linear mathematical operations in Python. It provides graphical representation and a tkinter-based application to plot quadratic graphs.

2. Files:
- arithmetic_and_quadratic.py: Performs basic arithmetic and solves quadratic equations.
- linear_equation.py: Plots a linear function y = mx + c.
- tkinter_app.py: A GUI to input coefficients a, b, c and view the quadratic graph.

3. Libraries Used:
- math
- matplotlib
- numpy
- tkinter

4. How to Run:
- Ensure Python and required libraries are installed (`pip install matplotlib numpy`).
- Run the scripts individually using a Python interpreter.

5. Screenshots:
(Attach screenshots of graph and GUI output in your submission)

6. Learning Outcome:
- Understanding of equations and plotting using matplotlib.
- GUI development using tkinter.
- Application of logic and Python functions to simulate mathematical problems.
